Hi.
I am a full stack web developer.
I've rich experience about Django, jquery.
I have checked your site.
So I aill add search filter below Gscore and send the jquery request for industry.
Django backend will get the query and excute sql query so that find all industries containning the parameter.
I will use your https://www.konaequity.com/find/--TX/?google_industry=Chiropractor url.
For now search url is like that so I can add more parameter behind of query.
https://www.konaequity.com/find/--/?arn=3100740&arx=45992644&empn=117&empx=323&gn=4&gx=7&name=TestGorilla&google_industry=Chiropractor
I want to discuss it more over chat. Kindly initiate a personal conversation to discuss more in detail.
Thank you for your time.

Georgi Iljin 1:16 PM
Hi

Thank you for your offer.

JR
Joey R 1:19 PM
I’m a bit concerned by your English. I think it might be a communication barrier so when you are writing please try to be careful with what you are trying to say

Georgi Iljin 1:20 PM
I see.

I can implement your idea.

JR
Joey R 1:23 PM
Great. How would you handle the 4,000 industries?

Georgi Iljin 1:25 PM
Pagination will be used.

If there is an issue with db I will find the fastest way to excute queries.

Such as fulltext search etc.

One question.

Are you using mysql?

Even though there are 4000 industries I can solve this issue using index and pagination.

JR
Joey R 1:29 PM
I dont think pagination is the right approach. That is not very elegant

yes mysql

if you try to sign up for a google my business account, you can see how they implement full text search to look for industries

Georgi Iljin 1:31 PM
I see.

I will check now.

For now if I type "test" text in the search input box auto complete drop down will be appeared.

Where can I find the full text search example?

JR
Joey R 1:41 PM
https://www.google.com/business/

Google Business Profile - Get Listed on Google

when you go through the sign up flow there is a page that asks you for your industry and then you start typing and it shows you your options

Georgi Iljin 1:43 PM
I see. Thanks.

Georgi Iljin 1:52 PM
I checked.

So what is your plan?

I think only 4000 counts are not problem.

I can implement quick search function.

JR
Joey R 1:56 PM
okay

do you have any examples of anything you have built that is similar?

JR
Joey R 2:05 PM
okay

are you clear on the project requirements?

Georgi Iljin 2:06 PM
Yes.

One question only.

Regardign keyword "Chiropractor"

Need to find all industries with a title or description containing this keyword?

JR
Joey R 2:10 PM
https://propellic.com/blog/google-my-business-categories/

Propellic
Google My Business Categories List [Updated for 2021] | PCL® 
There are 3920 Google My Business categories. Need help figuring out which one you belong in? Search our list with these guidelines.
So underneath the box that says select category, there is another box that says select industry. A user clicks into that box and starts typing "chir" - the option that would be present would be chiropractor. But if they just typed in "chi" it would show first the results that have chi at the beginning like Chicken Hatchery, Chicken Restaurant, Chicken Shop, etc

Georgi Iljin 2:15 PM
I see.

You are meaning auto compelete. Correct?

JR
Joey R 2:16 PM
yes

you can see if they clicked chicken shop, it would work too

The search result page is finished.

I have to implelment add industry category filter and auto complete within 4000 categores.

Correct?

JR
Joey R 2:19 PM
yes

Georgi Iljin 2:19 PM
I got it.

JR
Joey R 2:19 PM
and to make it work with the search parameters

Georgi Iljin 2:19 PM
Oh. I see.

JR
Joey R 2:20 PM
in a very clean code that is maintainable for the next developer

Georgi Iljin 2:21 PM
I see.

I will.

JR
Joey R 2:22 PM
okay any other questions?

Georgi Iljin 2:22 PM
No.

If i have any question I will let you know.

JR
Joey R 2:23 PM
how do you plan on adding the 4000 industries?

Georgi Iljin 2:24 PM
I will create new table having these categories.

Then there is no spped issue.

JR
Joey R 2:25 PM
is that a better solution than a python file?

Georgi Iljin 2:25 PM
Same.

Read file file vs DB.

I prefer database table for maintenance.

JR
Joey R 2:28 PM
I would prefer a python file because our database is capricious haha. Meaning we had a developer delete a migrations file and I'm afraid about any major database problems or outtages.

Our testing site shares a database with our production site, by the way. So I can't have any testing really on our databases that break anything

we have 2.3 million company record

and the site gets almost 5,000 people visiting a day

Georgi Iljin 2:29 PM
I see.

I understand.

My working shouldnot affect your business.

I will do that.

JR
Joey R 2:31 PM
Okay. Last thing. Can you resummarize everything in this task back to me? That way I will know we are on the same page.

Georgi Iljin 2:32 PM
Okay.

I will explain.

First I will add filter input box that reflects industry category.

When use inputs keywords auto completed text hints from 4000 categories.

will be shown.

After we click one categorry item and click search button it will take us to category search page.

Like that.

https://www.konaequity.com/find/--TX/?google_industry=Chiropractor&page=6

The 4000 recordes will be stored in file so that my work doesn't affect the live service and clean code for maintenance.

That's all.

JR
Joey R 2:35 PM
BEAUTIFUL

Georgi Iljin 2:35 PM
Thanks.

JR
Joey R 2:35 PM

Joey R sent an offer

 2:41 PM
Aloha django + jquery devs -

Looking to hire a javascript expert to add an additional filter to our website, The website is growing quite fast and we just passed a million pageviews.

The page that we are trying to improve is https://www.konaequity.com/find/ & this page has many variations depending on the users search parameters.

To give you an idea of how the page is used, investors come to our site because they have an investment thesis and they want to build a list of companies that could be potential investments. So a user may say I want to find chiropractors in texas.

Currently our backend has the capability to run that search but we are missing a filter to allow users to run that query.

This job is to add a new filter for industries. Example:

https://www.konaequity.com/find/--TX/?google_industry=Chiropractor

There are 4,000 of these industries like Chiropractor so we need to load the options in a way that doesn't slow down the page and a method where users can search through all of the industries easily. This filter should appear when a user clicks show filters and then it should be placed under the filter that says select category.

Pretty simple and straightforward task. I am looking for someone who is okay working with messy code and has excellent written communication.

To ensure, that you have read this entire post, please use the word industries. I will only be responding to applicants that use the word industries. Thank you.

Why don’t you just use use test site?

Georgi Iljin 8:22 PM
The python version is exactly 3.8.0.

I am going to run github code on my local and trying to deploy it to test server.

So you mean I directly work in test server?

JR
Joey R 8:24 PM
yeah - it would be faster

Also did you look at newrequirements.txt?

Georgi Iljin 8:25 PM
No.

I didn't see it.

Could you send me it?

I added one by one.

Can I deply to test server when I finish my working?

JR
Joey R 9:01 PM
It would be better if you just copy in your updated code

Georgi Iljin 9:01 PM
You mean I upload my changed files only?

JR

Yes

Georgi Iljin 9:02 PM

I want to add a contact search

Just like the p2 but instead of companies, users can search for people

Georgi Iljin 8:23 AM
I see.

JR

we have the data in hubspot so we would need to create a new database

Georgi Iljin 8:24 AM
I see.

JR

Looks like you deleted the /people/ page unfortunately

Georgi Iljin 8:26 AM
There is an error on this page.

To run the project I did. Sorry I fogot to tell you.

JR
Joey R 8:26 AM
okay

JR
Joey R 8:48 AM
Hopefully you saw it while it was still live..

Georgi Iljin 8:49 AM
Yes.

JR
Joey R 8:50 AM
So basically users and visitors can search for people based on name, company name, job title, location, category, industry, revenue, employees, and tags(this is a new one. The tags are Owner, C-Suite, VP, Director, Manager)

Georgi Iljin 8:51 AM

Georgi Iljin 8:55 AM
Okay.

JR
Joey R 8:56 AM
How long might this take?

Also currently the site is showing contacts from hubspot's api. We can't do that with people search because it would exceed the api limits. So we would have to upload a new database. It would have 1.2 million records

This new database would have to sync with hubspot so whenever we make updates in hubspot or add people it would sync with this new database

That is the way our company database works currently

Georgi Iljin 9:03 AM
I see.

We have to add contact from api every time we request.

JR
Joey R 9:04 AM
we would do one big import of 1.2 million records and then future update would come from the api

Georgi Iljin 9:04 AM
Add new ones only.

JR
Joey R 9:04 AM
yes

Georgi Iljin 9:05 AM
I see.

Mysql database will be used.

?

JR
Joey R 9:05 AM
yes

Georgi Iljin 9:05 AM
So now we will import 1.2m records now initailly.

And new data from api will be appended.

JR
Joey R 9:06 AM
yes

Georgi Iljin 9:06 AM
I think we should serious about database structure.

It will affect search speed.

So many records.

JR
Joey R 9:07 AM
yes optimization would help

Georgi Iljin 9:07 AM
Okay

So when users will search people every time we will append data in backend?

JR
Joey R 9:10 AM
not sure what you mean?

Georgi Iljin 9:10 AM
I mean each user will search the people.

with the hubspot api.

Every time we get response from api server.

We will add contacts to database?

I ask you because there are many records, so inserting data and indexing take time.

Insert new record takes time.

So for each response from many customers will cause issues.

JR
Joey R 9:13 AM
nope

Georgi Iljin 9:14 AM
I have experience regarding this.

JR
Joey R 9:14 AM
when we create the database we will dump all records in

wont use the api at all

Georgi Iljin 9:15 AM
So there is not need to add more records from api?

We only use 1.2m records?

JR
Joey R 9:15 AM
over time if I update records into hubspot then it will sync into the database via api

Georgi Iljin 9:15 AM
Okay.

Then you will give me the test database I will work?

JR
Joey R 9:19 AM
well currently the test site and production site share the databases

Georgi Iljin 9:19 AM
Okay.

JR
Joey R 9:19 AM
the test site is on too small of a hosting plan

Georgi Iljin 9:19 AM

What is your budget?

what should thiscost you?

Georgi Iljin 9:21 AM

I will follow you.

In fact my hourly is $40.

Can you tell me the url for people search now?

JR
Joey R 4:16 PM
We don’t have people search now this is a new feature that should exist at /people

Georgi Iljin 4:18 PM
Then where is people?

You mean /people route?

I mean People button.

The button let us go to people search page.

JR
Joey R 4:21 PM
When this feature is built it will exist in the header bar

Georgi Iljin 4:23 PM
Okay.

Then I will create route and implement ui and function.

No problem.
